\begin{homeworkProblem}
A \textbf{tournament} is said to have \textit{k}-leader property if for every set of k players there is one who beats them all. Consider a random tournament with $n$ players. Fix $k$ players. (Tournament on $n$ vertices is a directed graph, having exactly one arrow between each pair of vertices.)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the event \textbf{"No player beats all these k"}, has probability $(1-2^{-k})^{n-k}$
\item Consequently, if ${n \choose k}(1-2^{-k})^{n-k} < 1$, then there is a \textit{k}-leader tournament with $n$ players.
\item Show that for all large $n$ this inequality holds and hence \textit{k}-leader tournaments are possible
\item If $f(k)$ is the least such n, show that f(1) = 3 and f(2) = 7.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
Three dice are rolled. Given that no two show the same face, find the conditional probability that at least one is an ace\\~\\
\solution \\
\begin{equation}\label{8:condProb}
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(A)}
\end{equation}
Let us first calculate the probability that of the three dice no two show the same face. Call that probability $P(A)$\\
For the first die, no of possibilities =  6 \\
For the second die, no of possibilities =  5 \\
For the third die, no of possibilities =  4 \\

We know that total number of outcomes of the a three dice system are $6^3$\\
Hence, we have $$P(A) = \frac{6\cdot5\cdot4}{6^3}$$

We now calculate the probability that one of them is an ace.\\
There are three exclusive cases for this:\\
a) Ace belongs to the first dice, \\ b) Ace belongs to the second dice, \\c) Ace belongs to the third dice.\\

Let us solve the a) case. The rest have similar arguments.\\
Given that ace is fixed in the first place, we have \\
For the second die, no of possibilities =  5 \\
For the third die, no of possibilities =  4 \\

A similar argument holds for the other cases.\\
Hence, we have
\[
P(A\cap B) = \frac{3\cdot1\cdot5\cdot4}{6^3}
\]

Using \eqref{8:condProb}{}, we have: 
\[
	P(A|B) = \frac{3\cdot1\cdot \cancel{5} \cdot \cancel{4}}	{6\cdot \cancel{5} \cdot \cancel{4}}
\]
\[\implies P(A|B) = \frac{1}{2}\]

A die has four red faces and two white faces and a second die has two red and four white faces. A fair coin is flipped once. If it falls heads, we keep on throwing the first die and if it falls tails, we keep on throwing the second die.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the probability of red at any throw is $\frac{1}{2}$
\item If the first two throws result in red what is the conditional probability of red at the third throw?
\item If red turns up at the first n throws, what is the conditional probability that the first die is being used?

\begin{homeworkProblem}
For any events $A_i,\ldots,A_n$ in an experiment show $P(\bigcup A_i) \leq \sum{P(A_i)}$. This is called union bound (or Boole's inequality)\\ For any two events $A$ and $B$ show that $$P(A\cap B) \geq P(A) + P(B) - 1$$
This is called a Bonferroni inequality.\\
The inclusion-exclusion formula we proved for probability of union of events is sometimes called Poincare formula.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
Fix $0 < p < 1$. Then $G(n,p)$ is the (undirected) random graph model where we have $n$ vertices and where edges are chosen independently each with probability $p$. Let $q_n$ be the probability that the graph is disconnected. Show $$q_n \leq \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}{n \choose k}(1-p)^{k(n-k)} \leq \sum_{k=1}^{[n/2]}{(n(1-p)^{n/2})^k} \to 0$$
Thus $1-q_n \to 1$. This is expressed by saying that, in this model, almost every graph is connected. A better way to think is that, as $n$ becomes large, our random graph is connected with overwhelming probability.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
In an experiment $P(A) = 0.4$ and $P(A \cup B) = 0.7$. Determine $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $A, B$ are independent.
\item $A, B$ are disjoint.
\end{enumerate}
\solution
\begin{enumerate}
\item Since A, B are independent, we know that $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$. \\ Also, we know that $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$ \\ \\ On substituting, we get $ 0.7 = 0.4 + P(B) - 0.4\times P(B)$ \\ $\implies$ $0.3 = P(B) - 0.4 \times P(B)$ \\ $\implies$ $0.3 = 0.6 \times P(B)$
\\ $\implies$ $P(B) = 0.5$
\\
\item Since A, B are disjoint, we know that $P(A \cap B) = 0$
\\
$0.7 = 0.4 + P(B)$
\\
$\implies$ $P(B) = 0.3$

Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph (given to you). Choose points of $V$ at random, each with probability 1/2. Let $T$ be the random set so obtained. Call an edge 'crossing edge' if one end is in $T$ and the other in $V-T$. Since $T$ is random, the number $X$ of crossing edges is a random variable. Show that $\E(X) = e/2$ where $e$ is the number of edges, that is, cardinality of E.\\
Deduce that a graph with $n$ vertices and $e$ edges must have a bipartite subgraph with at least $e/2$ edges.\\

\begin{enumerate}

Consider a Erdos-Renyi random graph, where each edge is chosen, independent of others, with probability $p$. Say that a pair of vertices (unordered) is good, if either they are joined OR they are joined to a common vertex. Let $X$ be the number of bad (not good) pairs. Since the graph is random, $X$ is a random variable. Show that
\[
\E(X) \leq {n \choose 2} {(1 - p^2)}^{n-2} \to 0

Deduce that $P(X \geq 1) \to 0$. Conclude that almost every graph has diameter 2.\\
Diameter of a graph is the largest possible distance between pairs of vertices and distance between a pair of vertices is the number of edges in the shortest path joining them (if no such path exists between a pair of vertices then the distance between them is $\infty$).
